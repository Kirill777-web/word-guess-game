# JavaScript Guess Game

## Description

The JavaScript Guess Game is a simple, interactive web-based game where players are tasked with guessing a word, in this case, "JavaScript", within a limited time 10 seconds. As the time ticks down, players type in their guesses. A win is registered if the player successfully guesses the word within the time frame, and a loss is recorded otherwise.

## Features

- Timer countdown to add a sense of urgency.
- Real-time feedback on your guessing progress.
- Track of wins and losses.
- Responsive design - play on any device!
- Ability to restart the game once it's over.

## Instalation

## How to Use

1. **Load the Game**: Open the game in your favorite web browser.
2. **Start the Game**: Click on the 'Start' button to initiate the game. Once clicked, the timer will start counting down.
3. **Guess the Word**: Begin typing letters to guess the word. Correctly guessed letters will replace the underscores in the word.
4. **End of Game**:
   - If you successfully guess the word "JavaScript" before the timer runs out, you win! A message will display, celebrating your victory.
   - If the timer reaches zero before you've fully guessed the word, you'll see a "Word Not Guessed" message, indicating a loss.
5. **Restart**: After each round, the 'Start' button will be re-enabled, allowing you to play again.

## Requirements

- Modern Web Browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Keyboard for typing guesses.

## Tips

- Begin by guessing common vowels like "a" and "e" to quickly uncover parts of the word.
- The word remains the same, so use each round as a learning opportunity.
